# About
A Year 13 project which I didn't finish at the time. It's a web app that helps you learn Mandarin Chinese, but with only one lesson.
This is a continuation from 'Prototype 3'. Adding new lessons will basically be a copy and paste of the first lesson.

# Main Features
- **New Words:** Each new word is presented to show its meaning, how to write it and how it's pronounced.
- **Sentences:** Shows the example sentences where the new words are used.
- **Memory Game:** Help memorise the new words by playing the tile flip game.
- **Test Assessment:** Users are assessed on their knowledge of the new words with a mix of questions.
